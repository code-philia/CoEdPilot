## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Our model scripts require **Python 3.10** and **Pytorch with CUDA.**  

Using `pip` (with Python 3.10):

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or using `conda` :

```shell
conda create -n coedpilot python=3.10.13
conda activate coedpilot
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
